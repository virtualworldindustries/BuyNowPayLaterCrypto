# EtherPay 💸

## About
Inspired by AfterPay's - buy now, pay later - buisness model, we decided to create an Ethereum equivalent version. 
Currently, you are only allowed to borrow up to 4x your initial deposit: i.e. 1:4 ratio (1 ether deposit, 4 ether worth borrow). 
When the user deposits the initial eth, say 1 eth, they will later pay 3 installments, each occurring every 2 months over a 6 month period, with an additional 3-7% fee.
